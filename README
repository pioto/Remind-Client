Remind-Client
=============

This distribution contains the Remind::Client class, which makes
building clients to run on top of Remind's "Server Mode" easier.

It also provides a sample implementation of a subclass which sends all
timed reminders to libnotify, and a script which executes it.

This module has different goals from Remind::Parser. Remind::Parser is
meant to parse all of the available reminders once, into a list.
Remind::Client, on the other hand, lets remind take care of all the
heavy lifting. It is a relatively thin layer on top of remind, which
responds to reminder events.
